				<h4>Who are the people behind?</h4>
				<p><strong>SUN Ruoyu (<a href="http://insraq.me/">Insraq</a>, PAC, Year 3/4, CUHK)</strong>, Founder, Lead Developer, UI Designer. In charge of Code Architecture and UI/UX Design.</p>
				<p><strong>ZHAO Naichuan (<a href="http://nelsonz.info/">Nelson</a>, PAC, Year 4/4, CUHK)</strong>, Co-founder, Developer in charge of "Schedule". Also in charge of Marketing and Product Strategy.</p>
				<p><strong>YIN Ming (Dick, IE, Year 3/4, CUHK)</strong>, Co-founder, Developer in charge of "Map". Also in charge of Marketing and Graphics Design.</p>
				<div class="separate"></div>
				<h4>... and why?</h4>
				<p>We are a group of people (geeks) who love Web 2.0 Applications. And believe that there can be a lot of improvements to CUHK's current information system. Technology should not be a barrier, it should make a better life. Interestingly, we have similar principles in designing the prodcut: put user experience first. During the development, we will check with each other to avoid any possible usability mistakes.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid_4">
				<h4>The current progress</h4>
				<p>The coding progress is almost finished. We plan to fully test and optimize the code and focus on user experience and documentations.</p>
				<h4>In the near future</h4>
				<p>We plan to participate in some innovation competitions to gain more experience and more feedbacks from other perspectives. We want to implement the idea in CUHK first.</p>
				<h4>In the faraway future</h4>
				<p>The final goal is to push this to the market and benefit more people. But everything is subject to change and there will be lots of obstacles.</p>
